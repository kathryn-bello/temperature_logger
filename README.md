# BME280 Temperature Logger

This Python script continuously logs temperature, humidity, and pressure readings from a BME280 sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi. Data is saved to a CSV file every hour for easy long-term monitoring and analysis.

# Future Improvements
- Data Logging & Storage
- Rotating CSV files (daily/weekly?)
- SQLite storage for queries
- Cloud backup (Google Drive, AWS S3, Dropbox)
- JSON or Parquet export for analysis

Visualization
- Real-time graphs with matplotlib, plotly, or dash
- Web dashboard via Flask or FastAPI
- Data analysis?
